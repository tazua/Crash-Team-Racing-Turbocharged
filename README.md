# Crash Team Racing: Turbocharged
<img src="screenshots/game1.jpg"></img><br>
Crash Team Racing: Turbocharged is a fork of [Crash Team Racing: High Octane](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/Crash-Team-Racing-High-Octane), a sourceport for PSVita, PC (Windows) and Web Browser based on the [ctr-native](https://github.com/CTR-tools/ctr-native) project. Turbocharged extends High Octane with additional rendering, precision, and quality-of-life options.

This fork is focused on PC operating systems, especially Windows and Linux. The PSVita and Web Browser builds are not supported in Turbocharged. See the [Roadmap](#roadmap) for planned platforms and features.

**Website:** [ctr.cmzi.uk](https://ctr.cmzi.uk) has an overview of the features, a PS1-vs-Turbocharged comparison, the trailer and downloads.

## First-time setup (Windows / Linux)

### 1. Download and extract the latest release

Open [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CameronRedmore/Crash-Team-Racing-Turbocharged/releases) and choose the newest Turbocharged release, including a beta if that is the latest available. Under **Assets**, download the archive for your operating system:

- **Windows:** `ctr-turbocharged-<version>-windows-x86.zip`
- **Linux:** `ctr-turbocharged-<version>-linux-x86.AppImage` or `ctr-turbocharged-<version>-linux-x86.tar.gz`

You can also download from [the website](https://ctr.cmzi.uk), which offers the newest build from the `turbocharged` branch for your platform.

Choose a game download rather than GitHub's **Source code** downloads. For ZIP/tar.gz archives, extract the entire archive into a folder you can write to, keeping the executable and its `assets` folder together. Settings, saves, and caches are stored in this folder.

**Linux AppImage:** make the downloaded file executable (`chmod +x ctr-turbocharged-<version>-linux-x86.AppImage`) and launch it. The first launch creates the game data folder at `~/.local/share/ctr-turbocharged` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ctr-turbocharged` if configured). For the steps below, use that folder as `Turbocharged/`. The disc setup popup copies your selected image into its `assets/ctr-u.bin`; the optional font goes in `assets/fonts/crash-a-like.ttf`. Settings and saves live there too, so replacing the AppImage keeps your progress.

To use an existing installation or another writable data folder, run `CTR_TURBOCHARGED_DATA_DIR="/absolute/path/to/Turbocharged" ./ctr-turbocharged-<version>-linux-x86.AppImage`. If FUSE is unavailable, add `--appimage-extract-and-run` immediately after the AppImage filename.

The PC builds are 32-bit and require an OpenGL 3.3 capable GPU/driver. On Linux, including with the AppImage, you also need 32-bit glibc, graphics, windowing, and audio runtime libraries; see the release's `README.txt` for requirements. Use your distribution's packages for these dependencies.

### 2. Add your game disc image

Game data is not included. Dump your own **NTSC-U (US) retail Crash Team Racing** disc, then launch Turbocharged. If the game cannot load its required assets, a **disc setup popup** lets you choose the raw BIN file. It checks the sector layout, NTSC-U executable/boot configuration, required game files and audio manifest, and reads every sector for structural/read errors. The checks validate compatibility and structure, rather than comparing the image against a retail checksum.

The image is copied automatically to **`assets/ctr-u.bin`** in the installation/data folder; your original is kept. A progress window stays open during validation and copying. Invalid images show a reason and can be retried. Replacing an existing image requires confirmation; the copied file is checked before it replaces the existing image.

You can also name the raw BIN image **`ctr-u.bin`** and place it manually in the game's **`assets`** folder:

```text
Turbocharged/
  Crash Team Racing - Turbocharged.exe   (Windows)
  ctr_native                            (Linux)
  assets/
    ctr-u.bin
    dualshock.png
    fonts/
      FuzzyBubbles-Bold.ttf
      FuzzyBubbles-OFL.txt
```

ZIP/tar.gz downloads contain the executable for your chosen platform; keep the other supplied files in place. The AppImage contains its executable internally and copies the supplied fonts and overlay into your data folder on launch.

The disc image must use **raw MODE2/2352 sectors**, with the data track starting at byte 0. A standard **2048-byte `.iso` is not supported**: renaming it to `.bin` will not restore the XA audio and STR video data. If your dump has a BIN/CUE pair, use the raw BIN file; the game does not load the CUE. You do not need to extract `BIGFILE.BIG`, audio, or video files separately. On Linux, the file picker uses your desktop's file dialog service (XDG portals or Zenity); if unavailable, use manual placement.

### 3. Add the optional Crash-a-Like font

**Luckiest Guy from Google Fonts is bundled**, so no extra font download is needed. Choose **Use Luckiest Guy** in first-time setup, or select **Options > Interface > Font > LUCKIEST GUY**. The Turbocharged preset uses Crash-a-Like when it is installed, otherwise Luckiest Guy. ORIGINAL remains available, and PS1/Vanilla+ presets use it. Existing saved font selections keep their meaning.

First-time setup offers an **optional font step** after disc import, or when you first launch with the disc already installed. If you already have Crash-a-Like, choose **Choose Crash-a-Like** and select its extracted TTF. Setup checks the TrueType header and required font tables, then copies it to **`assets/fonts/crash-a-like.ttf`**, keeping your original. Existing fonts require confirmation before replacement; a valid installed font skips this step.

To download Crash-a-Like instead, choose **Open README** for these instructions. Download [Crash-a-Like by Aryel Filipe from DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/crash-a-like.font) and extract the font archive. You can also copy **`crash-a-like.ttf`** manually into **`assets/fonts/`**. Create that folder if necessary. The final path must be:

```text
Turbocharged/assets/fonts/crash-a-like.ttf
```

Copy the TTF itself, rather than the ZIP or an extra containing folder. It does not need to be installed as a system font. Start the game and select **Options > Interface > Font > CRASH-A-LIKE**. If the game was already running when you added the file, restart it first.

Crash-a-Like is optional and is not redistributed by this project. **ORIGINAL** uses the game's existing font. The Fuzzy Bubbles font used for the TURBOCHARGED title lettering is already included in the release. Both bundled fonts are unmodified and ship with full licences and attribution: Luckiest Guy under Apache 2.0 and Fuzzy Bubbles under SIL OFL 1.1. See [bundled font notices](assets/fonts/README.md).

### 4. Launch and configure

- **Windows:** run `Crash Team Racing - Turbocharged.exe` from the extracted folder.
- **Linux archive:** open a terminal in the extracted folder and run `./ctr_native`. If its executable permission was lost during extraction, run `chmod +x ctr_native` first.
- **Linux AppImage:** launch the executable `.AppImage` file; its setup popup can import the disc image on first launch.
- **Raspberry Pi 5 / RetroPie:** a 32-bit ARM build and a RetroPie port module are described in [docs/RASPBERRY_PI5.md](docs/RASPBERRY_PI5.md).

Use **Options** to configure controls, graphics, and your preferred frame rate. F11 switches between windowed and borderless fullscreen. The game creates `config.ini` for settings and `memcards/` for saves; keep the installation folder writable and back up your saves before replacing an older installation. Starting with `--fullscreen` or `--windowed` overrides the saved window mode for that run only, so a launcher can pass it every time without changing your setting; `--help` lists the command-line options.

PAL voiceovers and custom characters are optional; their setup is described below. Python and xdelta3 are only needed for the optional conversion tools.

**Linux display server:** 64-bit builds use SDL's default driver selection (native Wayland on Wayland desktops). 32-bit builds do not get along with GPU drivers under native Wayland, so the 32-bit build runs through X11 by default, using XWayland on Wayland desktops, and only falls back to Wayland if X11 is unavailable. A `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland` setting in your environment is ignored. To really use native Wayland, also set `CTR_TURBOCHARGED_ALLOW_WAYLAND=1`. Other `SDL_VIDEODRIVER` values, such as `x11`, are respected.

**Linux audio:** the game tries PulseAudio, then PipeWire, then ALSA. Because the build is 32-bit, it can only use the 32-bit client libraries you have installed (for example `lib32-libpulse` or `lib32-pipewire`). If a driver opens but you hear nothing, such as ALSA on a PipeWire system without a 32-bit ALSA bridge, force one with `SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER`, for example `SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER=pipewire ./ctr_native`. In Steam, set the launch options to `SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER=pipewire %command%`. Try `pulseaudio` if that does not help. Running from a terminal prints the driver in use as `SDL audio stream opened: driver=...`.

If startup fails, check the exact `assets/ctr-u.bin` location and image format first. On Linux, run from a terminal and check `ldd ./ctr_native` for missing runtime libraries. When reporting a problem, include the release version, operating system, GPU/driver, and the game's `.log` file from the installation folder.

### Turbocharged exclusive features

- [PC, Native 3D] Options > Display > Aspect Ratio selects 4:3, 16:9, 16:10, 21:9 or 32:9. Select Native 3D under Options > Graphics > Renderer first. Aspect Ratio defaults to 16:9 and is saved as `aspect_ratio=0..4` in the order above. The selected ratio fits inside the current window or fullscreen display with black bars when necessary. Projection preserves the vertical field of view, while fonts, HUD icons and minimaps adapt to the selected ratio. Aspect Ratio and Renderer can be changed from the main menu; both are locked in the pause menu. Classic keeps its existing 16:9 presentation. Ultrawide modes use broader level visibility and may need more CPU/GPU time.
- [PC] Options > Gameplay > Engine Selection adds a second step to the existing character menu: choose Balanced, Acceleration, Speed or Turning independently of your character. The setting can be enabled in-game; the engine choice is made at the next character selection. Penta's special PAL profile is available once Penta is unlocked. Off by default; saved as `engine_selection=0/1`. Engine choices last for the current session. Ghosts retain the selected profile; results with an engine different from the character's default are kept locally and excluded from online leaderboard uploads.
- [PC] Main Menu > Unlocks lists the base game unlock requirements and current status. Browse a scrolling reward list with Up/Down (or Left/Right); the selected reward’s status and wrapped requirements appear in a separate panel. Penta’s relic requirement is listed; N. Oxide appears when Additional Unlocks is enabled.
- [PC] Options > Gameplay > Additional Unlocks: earning a Gold (or Platinum) Relic on every Adventure track unlocks Penta Penguin; beating every N. Oxide ghost on the original Time Trial tracks unlocks N. Oxide. Oxide unlocks after completing the ghosts, and completed ghost progress is also recognized when the active Adventure profile loads or you enter a hub. On by default; saved as `additional_unlocks=0/1`.
- [PC] Options > Experimental > Kart Hue (Experimental) rotates the paint colour of human players' karts. Original keeps the retail colours; left/right adjusts the hue in 15-degree steps. Saved as `kart_hue`.
- New character, track, battle arena and scrapbook unlocks show a shared five-second popup with the reward name and a chime, including Additional Unlocks and Slide Coliseum's Adventure access. Multiple rewards queue; popups wait through loading, cutscenes, mask hints and active races. Existing rewards imported from saves do not trigger notifications.
- Selectable 30, 60, 90, 120, 144, and 240 FPS in the Options menu, with scaled game timing, interpolated model animation, and frame-rate-correct menu, UI, and effect animations. Higher rates need sufficient CPU/GPU performance; pacing retains the original NTSC clock (approximately 59.82 FPS for the 60 FPS setting).
- Additional FPS options and high precision rendering, including sub-pixel vertex precision and perspective-correct textures.
- High precision physics and collision options, level-of-detail overrides, and optional depth buffering.
- Adventure Mode character switching and automatic progress saving, with a CONTINUE option at the top of the Adventure menu that loads your last autosave directly.
- The in-game pause menu opens the options menu, with settings that are unsafe mid-race locked, plus a Gamepad / Vibration row.
- Options > Skip Mask Hints skips automatic Aku Aku / Uka Uka hint cutscenes in Adventure Mode while still unlocking each triggered hint in the Hints menu. Off by default; the setting is saved as `skip_mask_hints` in `config.ini`.
- [PC] HD Pause (Options > Interface): the pause backdrop is captured at full resolution instead of the original 4bpp tile grid. Off, Posterised or Smooth; the default is Smooth.
- An "all characters" unlock toggle in the cheats menu.
- [PC] PGXP option (Options > Graphics): sub-pixel vertex precision removes polygon wobble, and the Perspective setting also removes affine texture warping.
- [PC] Options > Gameplay groups independent Original/Smoothed settings for player physics, AI, collisions, and steering. Smoothed uses floating-point calculations; Original remains the default for player physics, AI and steering, while collisions default to Smoothed. Delete toggles player physics in development builds.
- [PC] Detail option (Options > Graphics): Maximum keeps tracks and models at their highest level of detail at every distance (sharpest textures, no low-poly models).
- [PC] Modern HUD Icons (Options > Interface): native vector cross, circle, square and triangle buttons, menu navigation arrows, and shaded race countdown lights. Independent of the Font and Modern Minimap settings. Off by default; saved as `modern_hud_icons=0/1`.
- [PC] Modern Minimap (Options > Interface): collision-derived minimap backgrounds and native vector markers, with persistent caching, smooth outlines, crossing edges and matching track select previews. Maps are prepared when enabled. Off by default; saved as `modern_minimap=0/1`.
- [PC] Depth Buffer (Options > Graphics): optional per-pixel depth testing corrects overlapping world polygons. Works with every PGXP setting; Off retains original polygon ordering; the default is On.
- [PC] Anti-aliasing option (Options > Graphics, cycle with left/right): Off, FXAA, MSAA 2x/4x/8x, or SSAA 2x/4x. MSAA smooths polygon edges at low cost; SSAA renders at 2x or 4x the pixel count and box-filters down, which also smooths texture and sub-pixel detail. FXAA remains the default; MSAA sample counts are capped at the GPU's limit.
- [PC] Resolution (Options > Graphics): PS1 renders at the original line count and horizontal pixel density (512x216 at 4:3, wider for wider aspects) and upscales with sharp bilinear filtering; HD renders at the window's resolution. Saved as `ps1_resolution`; the PS1 preset turns it on.

## Online leaderboard

The online leaderboard inherited from High Octane is disabled in Turbocharged. Time Trial and Relic Race results are only stored locally, and the game makes no network requests for it. It can be compiled back in by setting `CTR_NATIVE_HAS_LEADERBOARD` to 1 in `include/macros.h`, but that talks to the upstream author's server and is unsupported here.

## Tested Devices

These setups are confirmed working. Anything not listed has not been confirmed either way.

| OS | CPU | GPU / driver | Display | Build |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arch Linux (CachyOS, kernel 7.2), KDE Plasma on Wayland, running through XWayland | AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, driver 615.71.09 (OpenGL 4.6) | 16:9 | Linux 32-bit |

No Windows machine has been confirmed yet, so Windows reports are especially welcome.

### Help with testing

Please share what you find on your own hardware, whether it works or not. Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/CameronRedmore/Crash-Team-Racing-Turbocharged/issues) with your operating system and desktop/display server, CPU, GPU and driver version, which build you used (Windows zip, Linux tarball or AppImage), your renderer, aspect ratio and frame-rate settings, what worked and what didn't, and the `.log` file from the installation folder. Reports of working setups help as much as bug reports, and confirmed setups will be added to this table.

## Known Issues

- 32-bit libraries can cause issues with Wayland on some GPU drivers. Turbocharged therefore runs through X11 (XWayland) by default; see the Linux display server note above.
- Hue rotate (Options > Experimental > Kart Hue) can affect incorrect parts of some characters.

### Reporting bugs

Please report bugs through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CameronRedmore/Crash-Team-Racing-Turbocharged/issues) using the bug-report form. Include the release version, operating system, GPU/driver, relevant settings, steps to reproduce, and the game's `.log` file from the installation folder. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Roadmap

The roadmap now lives on the website: [ctr.cmzi.uk/#roadmap](https://ctr.cmzi.uk/#roadmap).

## Special controls bindings

- [PC] F11 is a shortcut to swap between Windowed and Fullscreen Borderless mode.

## How to Install

Follow [First-time setup (Windows / Linux)](#first-time-setup-windows--linux) above for release downloads, disc image placement, the optional font, and launch instructions.

## How to use PAL voiceovers

- Install Python 3.11 or higher ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
- Download [this script](https://github.com/CameronRedmore/Crash-Team-Racing-Turbocharged/raw/refs/heads/turbocharged/tools/extract_pal_voices.py) by right-clicking the link and selecting "Save link as..." or, if the script opens in the browser, "Save page as...".
- Place your PAL Crash Team Racing `.bin` dump in the same folder as the script.
- Open a command prompt in that folder by typing `cmd` in the File Explorer address bar and pressing Enter.
- Run `python extract_pal_voices.py YOUR_DUMP_NAME.bin`.
- When extraction is complete, place the generated `pal-voices` folder:
  - in the `mods` folder next to the CTR: Turbocharged executable, so that the final path is `mods/pal-voices`.

## How to add new custom characters to the game

- Install Python 3.11 or higher ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
- Download [this script](https://github.com/CameronRedmore/Crash-Team-Racing-Turbocharged/raw/refs/heads/turbocharged/tools/import_custom_racer.py) by right-clicking the link and selecting "Save link as..." or, if the script opens in the browser, "Save page as...".
- Install xdelta3 separately using your package manager or download it from the [official releases](https://github.com/jmacd/xdelta/releases). Put it on your `PATH` or place the executable in the same folder as the script (`xdelta3.exe` on Windows, `xdelta3` on Linux). It is not bundled with Turbocharged.
Download a custom character in the form of an `.xdelta` patch and place it in the same folder as the script.
- Place your NTSC-U Crash Team Racing `.bin` dump in the same folder as the script.
- Open a command prompt in that folder by typing `cmd` in the File Explorer address bar and pressing Enter.
- Run `python import_custom_racer.py YOUR_DUMP_NAME.bin YOUR_PATCH.xdelta YOUR_CHARACTER.ctrr`.
- If xdelta3 is installed elsewhere, add `--xdelta3 "PATH_TO_XDELTA3"` to the command.
- If the patch replaces multiple characters, the importer automatically generates one `.ctrr` per changed racer, adding the original character name to the requested output filename (for example `YOUR_CHARACTER_crash.ctrr`, `YOUR_CHARACTER_cortex.ctrr`, etc.).
- *NOTE*: For static custom models, the script can automatically retarget and bake the animations of the original character being replaced onto the custom model. To enable this, run `python import_custom_racer.py YOUR_DUMP_NAME.bin YOUR_PATCH.xdelta YOUR_CHARACTER.ctrr --template-animations`. Models that already contain animations will not be overwritten.
- When conversion is complete, place the generated `.ctrr` file or files:
  - in the `mods/customracers` folder next to the CTR: Turbocharged executable, so that the final path is `mods/customracers/YOUR_CHARACTER.ctrr`.

## Building from source

Requires CMake 3.20 or newer and a **32-bit target**: the game is a PS1 decompilation and still assumes 4-byte pointers. That means 32-bit x86 on Windows and Linux, or 32-bit ARM (armhf) on Linux for the Raspberry Pi 5 (see [docs/RASPBERRY_PI5.md](docs/RASPBERRY_PI5.md)). The version comes from the `VERSION` file.

SDL and other dependencies are vendored in `externals/`. Use the presets in `CMakePresets.json`:

| Platform | Configure | Build |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux (gcc-multilib) | `cmake --preset linux-gcc-i686-release` | `cmake --build build-linux-gcc-i686-release` |
| Windows (MinGW32 / MSYS2) | `cmake --preset windows-mingw-i686-release` | `cmake --build build-mingw-i686-release` |
| Windows (Visual Studio 2022) | `cmake --preset windows-msvc-x86` | `cmake --build --preset windows-msvc-x86-release` |
| Linux, 32-bit ARM OS (Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit) | `cmake --preset linux-gcc-armhf-release` | `cmake --build build-linux-gcc-armhf-release` |
| Linux, cross-compile to armhf (Debian or Pi OS 64-bit with `crossbuild-essential-armhf`) | `cmake --preset linux-gcc-armhf-cross-release` | `cmake --build build-linux-gcc-armhf-cross-release` |

Debug presets exist for Linux, including the armhf ones, and MinGW (`...-debug`) and MSVC (`windows-msvc-x86-debug`). The Linux build needs 32-bit development packages for X11, OpenGL, ALSA/PulseAudio, udev and D-Bus; `build.sh` lists the Debian/Ubuntu names and the CI workflow `.github/workflows/build-native.yml` has the full list. On Windows, install the MSYS2 MinGW32 toolchain described in `build.bat`.

Shortcuts: `./build.sh` (Linux), `build.bat` (MinGW) and `build-msvc.bat` configure, build and run the tests. The Linux executable is `build/ctr_native`; Windows builds produce `Crash Team Racing - Turbocharged.exe`. Run it from a folder containing `assets/ctr-u.bin`, or let the first-run popup import your disc.

### Linux packaging

After building, run `./package-linux.sh` from the source directory to create both the tar.gz archive and the AppImage, plus SHA-256 checksums, in `dist/`. It uses `VERSION` by default; pass a version as the first argument to override it. For a preset build, use `BUILD_DIR=build-linux-gcc-i686-release ./package-linux.sh`.

AppImage packaging requires an x86_64 Linux host, `curl`, `readelf` (binutils), and the usual shell/archive tools. The script downloads checksum-pinned appimagetool 1.9.1 and the i686 runtime 20251108 into `.cache/appimage-tools` on first use; later builds can use those cached files offline. Set `APPIMAGE_TOOL_CACHE` to choose a different cache directory. Packaging runs without FUSE. The same allowlist used for the tarball supplies the AppImage's bundled assets; retail game data and the optional Crash-a-Like font are supplied by the player.

The script also downloads pinned runtime/libfuse/squashfuse sources and creates an `AppImage-runtime-source.tar.gz` archive with licences and rebuilding instructions. It is included inside the AppImage and uploaded separately by CI; publish it and its checksum alongside the AppImage. Source and binary distributions include [third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) and full licence texts in `licenses/`.

For the tarball alone, use `./package.sh linux`. Linux CI builds and uploads both formats, runtime source, and their checksums, and checks the AppImage's version command without FUSE. The Raspberry Pi build is a tarball only: `ARCH=armhf BUILD_DIR=build-linux-gcc-armhf-cross-release ./package.sh linux`, which CI's `linux-armhf` job also produces.

### Tests

Tests run under `ctest --test-dir <build>`. The renderer integration tests are
off by default; configure with `-DCTR_NATIVE_RENDERER_TESTS=ON` to build them.
With that option enabled, there are currently 31 tests: 25 without the `gpu`
label and 6 that need an OpenGL context (the HUD icons test is disabled for
now). The headless font cache test skips unless `assets/fonts/crash-a-like.ttf`
is available in the source tree. To use another assets directory, configure
with `-DCTR_NATIVE_FONT_ASSET_DIR=/path/to/assets` (a CMake option, not an
environment variable).

```
ctest --test-dir build -LE gpu     # display-independent subset
ctest --test-dir build -L gpu      # requires an OpenGL context
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for bug-report details, pull requests,
formatting, and asset/licence requirements.

### Formatting

The decompiled upstream tree is not clang-format clean and never will be, so
the standard is scoped to the diff against the `turbocharged` branch (the scripts compare with `origin/turbocharged`, so run `git fetch origin turbocharged` first): your lines must conform, but you are never
forced to reindent code you did not write. Files this fork authored outright
are formatted in full.

The clang-format version is pinned in `.clang-format-version`, which
`check-format.sh`, the pre-commit hook and CI all read — output differs between
releases, so an unpinned checker disagrees with whatever you ran locally.

To get the format check on `git commit`:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This is not set automatically and is per-clone, so without it the gate is CI
only. `SKIP_FORMAT_HOOK=1` bypasses it for a single commit.

### Static analysis

`./check-tidy.sh` runs the repo's `.clang-tidy` checks over the files the fork
changed and summarises findings by check name. It is advisory in CI — the
config has been in the tree since upstream but nothing ran it, so the first
runs are about seeing what it reports. Pass `--strict` to make findings fail.

It needs a configured and built tree with a compile database, because the game
is a unity build: `game/game_unity.h` includes 261 `.c` files and `main.c`
includes that, so most changed files are not translation units and cannot be
handed to clang-tidy individually.

```
cmake --preset linux-gcc-i686-release && cmake --build build-linux-gcc-i686-release
./check-tidy.sh --build build-linux-gcc-i686-release
```
