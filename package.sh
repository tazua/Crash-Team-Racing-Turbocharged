Crash Team Racing: Turbocharged ${PLATFORM} ${ARCH} ${VERSION} build

Game assets are not included. You must provide your own copy of the game.

Simple setup:
- Run the game and choose your own NTSC-U retail CTR raw BIN image in the
  disc setup popup. It validates the image, then copies it automatically to
  assets/ctr-u.bin. Your original file is kept. Existing images require
  confirmation before replacement.
- Alternatively, place the image manually at:

assets/
  ctr-u.bin

- Run:

${RUN_HINT}

First-time setup also offers the optional Crash-a-Like menu/HUD font.
Choose the extracted TTF to check and copy it to assets/fonts/crash-a-like.ttf.
If you do not already have it, choose Open README and follow First-time setup
> Add the optional Crash-a-Like font, or choose Use Luckiest Guy: it is bundled.
README: https://github.com/CameronRedmore/Crash-Team-Racing-Turbocharged#3-add-the-optional-crash-a-like-font
After import, select Options > Interface > Font > CRASH-A-LIKE to use it.
Options > Interface > Font also offers LUCKIEST GUY and ORIGINAL.
The Turbocharged preset uses Crash-a-Like if installed, otherwise Luckiest Guy.
Bundled font licences and attributions are included beside the TTF files.

The disc image must be the common single-track raw PSX BIN layout:
MODE2/2352 sectors, with the data track starting at byte 0.
A cooked 2048-byte ISO does not preserve the XA/STR sector data needed for
audio and video playback.

Extracted asset override:

Extracted files are optional and mostly useful for development, modding, and
debugging. If present, they override files from ctr-u.bin.

assets/
  BIGFILE.BIG
  SOUNDS/KART.HWL
  TEST.STR
  XA/
    ENG.XNF
    ENG/EXTRA/S00.XA ... S05.XA
    ENG/GAME/S00.XA ... S20.XA
    MUSIC/S00.XA ... S01.XA

XA files must preserve CD-XA sector data. Use 2336-byte Mode2/Form2 sector data
or 2352-byte raw sectors. 2048-byte cooked XA extractions are not suitable.
